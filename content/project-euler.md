You're interested in mathematics and computer science?
Project Euler contains a collection of easy and challenging math problems.

Here is the preview of the first problem from the website's collection:

> "If we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3$, $5$, $6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$. Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$."

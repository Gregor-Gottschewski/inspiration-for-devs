# Inspiration for Devs

This repository contains a collection of inspirational websites, blogs, and games for developers.

"Inspiration for Devs" started as a response to the growing influence of AI in hobby programming.  
Our goal is to reclaim creativity, showcasing impressive projects, blogs, and articles created by humans.

The list is small but growing.
With your help, it can grow faster.
Create an issue with your recommendation, whether it is your own website or not.
